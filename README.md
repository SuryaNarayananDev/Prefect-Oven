## 🧠 What's the idea?

You’re hungry. You got food.  
You don’t have an oven 😭.  
Just open this app → choose a dish → see time + temperature → cook smartly (stove, pan, kadai — whatever!) 🚀

## 🛠 Tech Used

- React.js (because why not?)
- Plain CSS (no tailwind this time)
- Deployed on Vercel (super fast ⚡)
